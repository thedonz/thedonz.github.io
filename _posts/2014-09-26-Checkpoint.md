#Checkpoint: Git-tastic

The first week has been an unforgiving, deep-dive into the world of command-line ninjitsu and git wrangling.

As humans, learning new things is not as easy as inputting `CTRL + S`, so repetition then becomes our daily companion.

I've come to appreciate many aspects of Git, and as part of our weekend assigment, I'll find out how invaluable it is in software development.

One of the benefits of attending a program like [The Iron Yard](http://www.theironyard.com/refer), is the connections you make with your classmates. Orlando's first class is full of amazing, interesting and talented people.
Individuals from all walks of life, each with their own unique talents and skills; all eager to learn and help each other learn.

I feel incredibly lucky to be a part of such a diverse and passionate group of people, and look forward to the adventures we'll have in the coming weeks.

Of course, this couldn't be possible without the help of our awesome Campus Director, [Sarah Elbadri](https://twitter.com/thebadri) and our fearless Professor, [David Rogers](http://about.me/al_the_x).


Life is good. :)
