#"Foo On, Bar Off!"

*7th October 2014*

Sensei Rogers has taught me some drills that very much resemble---

Developing the "muscle memory" involved in software development is very much akin to mastering martial arts techniques. The ideas and processes have to be "baked" into the brain and one can only do that with constant repetition and practice.

I’ve come to fully embrace the [“Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship"](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/), because I very much enjoy the idea of pouring the best of oneself into your work; like a Japanese swordsmith forging *"nihonto"*.

I want to produce content that I can proud of. Content that, over time and with laborious effort, will increase in quality.

I’ve become quite enamored with this idea of using a **system of statements to manipulate a computer**; to create works of art that can change the world.
