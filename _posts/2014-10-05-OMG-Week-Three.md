#OMG Week Three!

*5th October 2014*

Taking a moment to come up to the surface for a quick blog post. Learning JavaScript has been a huge uphill battle — no that’s an understatement — it’s ridiculously hard. But nothing worth doing is ever easy and I feel that the changes that are happening on a subconscious level are going to allow me to plow through The Wall. The rapid-fire nature of a bootcamp forces your mind to adapt quickly to the difficulty of the task at hand. 

Luckily, and thanks to my classmates’ and professor’s support, it doesn’t feel like I’m fighting alone.

Let’s see what this week ends up looking like…
