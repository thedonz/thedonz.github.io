**Git** *(noun, informal, `british`): an unpleasant or contemptible person.*

--also--

*a popular version control system (VCS) developed by Linus Torvalds.*



Linus Torvald's [reasons](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Git_FAQ) for naming his version control software (VCS) Git follow the tradition of weird naming conventions for Internet things.

We've spent the last few days learning about the importance and power of keeping a solid VCS when talking to our "Robots"- which is how our awesome Philoso-fessor, [David Rogers](http://about.me/al_the_x), refers to the computers and software we use to craft our projects.

At this point, the use of Git to me is both obvious and frustrating. 

Coming from a design background, the idea of using the command line for something that I find much easier to understand when displayed graphically, has me in a confused state.

I'm "committed" to learning the command line, however, much to the comfort of my Professor- it's just going to take a little time and a whole lot of practice.
