_Nobody’s born smart. We all start at zero. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra. Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first. There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to ten. And Shakespeare had to learn his ABC’s just like the rest of us. Thankfully, we’re born to learn. Slowly, surely, you stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall. Frustrating, confusing, trying, struggling, until one day— you walk. One foot in front of the other, one idea on top of the next. Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger. Failing is just another word for growing and you keep going. This is learning. Knowing that you’ll get it, even if you haven’t gotten it— yet. Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand. Whoever you are, wherever you are, you only have to know one thing… You can learn anything._
 
There comes a point, when learning something difficult, that you begin to question your ability to learn said skill, much less master it.

You feel like Daniel Larusso right as he was about to receive a final, epic ass-kicking at the end of [Karate Kid 3](http://youtu.be/wTIu_aWSf6M). (Not the best Karate Kid, but probably my favorite ending.)

Fear and doubt begin to release their poison into the mind, clouding your judgment like rain in a storm. At times you can’t help but feeling hopeless, particularly when in a intense class like the Iron Yard, where you often see your peers blow past you in speedboats as you’re still trying to assemble a rickety raft from the debris the instructor tossed around you. 

But then you go out there, and talk to people who work in your industry-- peers and hiring managers-- and you can’t help but feel reassured when they inevitably offer the same advice: 

_“Don’t worry friend, I was there too. Just hang in there and keep learning."_

Mr. Miyagi said it best:

_“Is ok lose to opponent, must not lose to_ *FEAR*!_"_
