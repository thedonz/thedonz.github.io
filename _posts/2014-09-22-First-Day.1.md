#MIND FREAK

*22 September 2014*

So arriving at our desks, I wasn't sure what to expect. I was bouncing between apprehension and giddiness.
The Iron Yard has been the toughest challenge I've set for myself, and it is definitely a career change.

After having learned so much in the world of sales, I wanted to go back to my creative roots and delve into building things.

Software seemed like a good fit, and a safe bet considering the world-wide demand for developers.

I'll be documenting my journey through the Iron Yard here- both the victories and frustrations- to give at least one point of view
of what happens when you set sail in the ocean of ideas to find a new world...
