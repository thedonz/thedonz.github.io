#"Never go back on your word...and never give up! That's your ninja way!"

*9th October 2014*

*"Don't underestimate me! I don't quit and I don't run! You can act tough all you want! You're not gonna scare me off! No way! I don't care if I DO get stuck as a genin for the rest of my life! I'll still be Hokage someday!"*

In writing today’s blog piece, I came up with the following affirmation to ‘program’ into my brain:

>“I can learn to write excellent code. I can MASTER the art of computer programming. My brain is capable and eager to absorb, learn, and >creatively apply the principles of software engineering. I have the “technology”, all that is needed is dedication, focus and hard work. Do >it!"

These types of activities tend to prime my brain into receiving and processing the knowledge being acquired in a more effective way.

I think *believing* your brain can learn quickly and retain information effectively is a powerful tool in mastering any skill.

One of the peculiar aspects of learning in such an immersive program like The Iron Yard, is that you inevitably end up learning a lot about yourself. Learning styles, bad habits, even little tricks that you take for granted that you can teach others (OSX shortcuts anyone?) 

The instructors, campus staff & peers; these people really do care about your success, and when you spend so much time with them, friendships are bound to happen. These are people of the highest quality and caliber, and when you see how much they’re invested in your learning, you want to try even harder to succeed in the course. I’ve discovered that a layer of accountability has forced me to double down and really seek to truly understand the material because I want to build great things. 

I haven’t taken things apart at this level since I was a little boy, and thanks to our excellent learning materials --I’m looking at you, [Codeschool](http://www.codeschool.com) and [Treehouse!](http://referrals.trhou.se/carlosdonze) --it’s been an absolute joy.

I look forward to all the cool stuff I’m going to build using with all this knowledge.
