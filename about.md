#Oh, Hai! Hola! Bonjour! Hallo! 

###My name is Carlos and I like building stuff

I'm a designer by trade, and a storyteller at heart.  
Journeying into the depths of our humanity is my lifelong pursuit.  
Love and curiosity are my guiding [principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpaVLLObU80).  
I've spent the better part of the last three years diving into the world of startups, neuroscience, philosphy, art and software development.  
I prefer dogs, always choose breakfast food over anything else, paint in watercolor and want to learn to play the ukelele.
