#CSS Styles

Here are the styles used for the blog assignment.

* __text-align__ : used to align the text on the aside and the footer.

* __margin-left__: used to set the margin of the box in the sidebar to _4em's_ from the _left_ of the parent container.

* __background-size__: _cover_ - Used to set the top banner image to cover the entire screen and adjust as needed.

* __border-radius__: Makes the image frame round.

* __max-width__: Keeps the box from expanding beyond this point in pixels.

* __min-width__: Keeps the box from shrinking beyond this point in pixels.
