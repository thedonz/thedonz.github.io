#HTML Tags

Here are the tags used for the blog assignment.

_"Don't Tag me Bro!"_

NOTE: I'm ignoring the basic `<html>`, `<body>`, and `<hX>` tags because even my grandmother knows what these are.

* `<div>`: Is a styling tag that doesn't represent anything inherently. It's super useful for grouping sections of the page.

* `<section>`: A more correct semantic use of `<div>` for certain elements. (Typically used in a heading)

* `<article>`: Also a more correct semantic use of the `<div>` element. (This one is typically used for blog posts or news articles.)

* `<aside>`: Is typically used to contain a section of the page that is separate from the main flow, e.g. sidebars or inserts.
